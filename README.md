Edit Profile
============

Creates separate "Edit account" and "Edit profile" tabs for each user, with custom user fields configured under "Edit profile."

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

1. Install this module as you would any other. This will immediately result in
   the "Edit" tab on all user accounts being renamed to "Edit account".
2. If you haven't added any custom user fields yet, you won't yet see an "Edit
   profile" tab. To add user fields, go to Administration > Configuration >
   User Accounts > Account settings > Manage fields.
3. Once you've added some fields, all user accounts will get a new "Edit
   profile" tab on which they can edit their own values of the fields you
   added.
2. If User Pictures are enabled, the form to select/change the user picture will
  by default be found on the "Edit account" tab. To move this to the new "Edit 
  profile" tab, go to Administration > Configuration > User Accounts > 
  Edit Profile and check the box. This option will be disabled if User Pictures
  are not enabled.
